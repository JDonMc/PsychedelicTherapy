In this Guide you will find information relating to, what is the history of tripping, what is the product of tripping, what is the purpose of tripping, how do we trip, and so on.

This guide is intended for a mature audience, and is not a paid-for-act. People say "don't try this at home", but what we really mean is this is indended for preliminary secondary and tertiary practice. And may the great experiment continue safely.

In this Guide you will be treated as a Scientific Experimenter, and you will be treated as though you are in tandem with psychedelic therapists and their trainers.

A scientific experimenter first and foremost must be skeptical and reasonable, as well as document and experiment.








This is the experiment as follows.

A man hears heresay about a molecule.

A man researches about said molecule.

A man experiments with said molecule.

A man documents experiences with said molecule.

A man repeats said experiment.







Heresay is all you're going to hear about a molecule before ever actually doing the research.

Research is all you're ever going to read about a molecule before ever actually taking the molecule.

Experimenting is all you're ever going to do before documenting an experience.

Documenting an experience is all you ever can do until you understand all the interactions of all the receptors of molecules and all the physics and calculus associated with the mechanics of molecular pathways.










To fathom hell or soar angelic, just take a pinch of psychedelic.
